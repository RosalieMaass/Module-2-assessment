# Stock Analysis
## Analyizing a variety of stocks from 2017 and 2018 to find the best investments for Steve's parents
We started by looking at DQ stock since Steve's parents were mainly interested in this stock. We did this by looking at the total daily volume and finding the annual return. We discovered the return was -62%, showing this is not a good stock option

### Other Stock Options
We then looked at a larger variety of stocks from 2017 and 2018. We could copy and refactor our code from the original DQ assessment.
When comparing this data, only two stocks had a positive return in 2017 and 2018. Those stocks were RUN and ENPH as seen in the images below.
