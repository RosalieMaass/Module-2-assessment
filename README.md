# Stock Analysis
## Analyzing a variety of stocks from 2017 and 2018 to find the best investments for Steve's parents
We started by looking at DQ stock since Steve's parents were mainly interested in this stock. We did this by looking at the total daily volume and finding the annual return. We discovered the return was -62%, showing this is not a good stock option.

### Other Stock Options
We then looked at a larger variety of stocks from 2017 and 2018. We could copy and refactor our code from the original DQ assessment.
When comparing this data, only two stocks had a positive return in 2017 and 2018. Those stocks were RUN and ENPH as seen in the images below.

We can also see the amount of time it will take to run Steve's script. See images of the pop ups below:

### Summary
Refactoring has advantages and disadvantages. The process of analyzing this data was made simple by refactoring the code and refactoring can save a lot of time. However, whenever refactoring, you must go through and double check each line of code, and tweek different variables and statements. 
When expanding our analysis to multiple stocks, refactoring gave us a good starting point, even though it needed to be edited a bit before use.
